# Shiny Kounter

An Electron React desktop applicaiton that makes use of the PokemonAPI. This applicaiton was created to solve the problem of shiny pokemon hunting. It allows users to track the time and encounter amounts it takes to catch a shiny pokemon.

This is still a work in progress and is not complete.
